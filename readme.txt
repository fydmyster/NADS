Aiming is very finicky and takes getting used to.
The whole goal is to progress through floors by defeating enemies.

It's very buggy and super unfair - (I'm guessing some people are into that kind of thing)
I use Python along with Pygame for development - they're great tools.

-I had some performance issues related to having plenty enemies in the room so I limited them 
 and the room size in order to get things playable on ancient rigs like mine.

-The main intent of the game was to get into the habit of actually completing game projects
 I develop. So please forgive the minimalist design. ;) 

- Time is a valuable resource to everybody( especially hobbyist gamedevs like yours Truly)
 so I've subscribed to a 'get things done' approach. Hopefully there is something in the 
 source fellow tinkerers can benefit from, esp those starting out. That was the main intent 
 of developing NADS. I know, I know its a silly name. Enough rambling. Enjoy!
